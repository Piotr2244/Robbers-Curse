in folder called "Assets" all sources and assets are stored, most of them is taken from Unity Store. The proprietary game elements (assets, scripts, etc.) are located in the "My Assets" folder. The graphics used there are not created by me; instead, they are sourced from publicly available, legal sources. If any code fragment is not of my own creation, it has been explicitly labeled as such. The "Scenes" folder contains game scenes that are also my own creation.

Additionally, the built game is available for access via the following link:
